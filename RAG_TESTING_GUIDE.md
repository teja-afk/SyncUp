# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Testing Guide

## What is RAG?

RAG allows you to chat with your meeting data. It:
1. Breaks meeting transcripts into chunks
2. Creates embeddings (vector representations) using OpenAI
3. Stores embeddings in Pinecone vector database
4. Retrieves relevant context when you ask questions
5. Uses GPT-4 to generate answers based on that context

---

## Prerequisites

Before testing RAG, ensure you have:

### 1. Required Environment Variables
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # For embeddings and chat
PINECONE_API_KEY=...            # For vector storage
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=...         # Your Pinecone index name
```

### 2. Pinecone Setup
1. Go to https://www.pinecone.io/
2. Create a free account
3. Create an index with:
   - **Dimensions**: 1536 (for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - **Metric**: cosine
   - **Name**: meetbot-embeddings (or your choice)

### 3. User Account
- Sign up at http://localhost:3000/sign-up
- You need a user account to seed meetings

## Step-by-Step RAG Testing

### Step 1: Seed Sample Meeting Data

Run the seed script to create a sample meeting:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-sample-meeting.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üå± Starting to seed sample meeting data...
‚úÖ Found user: your-email@example.com
‚úÖ Created sample meeting: Q4 Product Planning Meeting
üìù Meeting ID: clxxx...
‚úÖ Created 3 transcript chunks

üéâ Sample meeting data seeded successfully!

üìã Next steps:
1. Run the RAG processor to create embeddings
2. Test the chat feature
3. View the meeting
```

**What this creates:**
- 1 complete meeting with transcript
- 3 transcript chunks in the database
- Action items and summary
- Ready for RAG processing

---

### Step 2: Process Meeting for RAG

Process the meeting to create embeddings:

**Option A: Using API (Recommended)**
```bash
# Replace MEETING_ID with the ID from Step 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meetingId":"MEETING_ID"}'
```

**Option B: Using Browser**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/meeting/MEETING_ID
2. The RAG processing should happen automatically
3. Check the console for processing logs

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Meeting processed for RAG",
  "chunksProcessed": 3,
  "vectorsCreated": 3
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Transcript chunks are retrieved from database
2. Each chunk is converted to embeddings via OpenAI
3. Embeddings are stored in Pinecone with metadata
4. Meeting is marked as `ragProcessed: true`

---

### Step 3: Test Chat with Single Meeting

**URL:** http://localhost:3000/meeting/MEETING_ID (scroll to chat section)

**Test Questions:**
```
1. "What was this meeting about?"
2. "What are the main action items?"
3. "Who is responsible for the analytics dashboard?"
4. "What is the deadline for mobile optimization?"
5. "What features were discussed?"
6. "Summarize the key decisions made"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI retrieves relevant chunks from Pinecone
- Generates contextual answers based on meeting content
- Cites specific information from the transcript
- Provides accurate details about action items and deadlines

---

### Step 4: Test Chat Across All Meetings

**URL:** http://localhost:3000/chat

**Test Questions:**
```
1. "What meetings have I had recently?"
2. "Show me all action items across my meetings"
3. "What topics were discussed in my meetings?"
4. "Who attended the Q4 planning meeting?"
5. "What are the upcoming deadlines?"
6. "Summarize all my meetings this month"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI searches across ALL meeting embeddings
- Aggregates information from multiple meetings
- Provides comprehensive answers
- Can compare and contrast different meetings

---

### Step 5: Verify in Pinecone Dashboard

1. Go to https://app.pinecone.io/
2. Select your index
3. Check "Vectors" tab
4. You should see vectors with metadata like:
   ```json
   {
     "meetingId": "clxxx...",
     "chunkIndex": 0,
     "meetingTitle": "Q4 Product Planning Meeting",
     "content": "Meeting transcript chunk..."
   }
   ```

---

## Advanced Testing

### Test Multiple Meetings

Create more sample meetings:

```bash
# Run the seed script multiple times with different data
npx tsx scripts/seed-sample-meeting.ts
```

Or manually create meetings through:
1. Google Calendar integration
2. Actual meeting recordings
3. Manual database entries

### Test RAG Performance

**Query Similarity:**
```
Ask: "What was discussed about analytics?"
Then: "Tell me about the dashboard feature"
```
Both should return similar, relevant information.

**Context Window:**
```
Ask: "What did Sarah say about the analytics dashboard?"
```
Should retrieve chunks where Sarah spoke about analytics.

**Multi-Meeting Context:**
```
Ask: "Compare the action items from all my meetings"
```
Should aggregate data from multiple meetings.

## Debugging RAG Issues

### Issue 1: No Results from Chat

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify meeting is processed
npx prisma studio
# Check Meeting table ‚Üí ragProcessed should be true
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reprocess the meeting
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meetingId":"MEETING_ID"}'
```

### Issue 2: Embeddings Not Created

**Check Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In your .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Must be valid
PINECONE_API_KEY=...   # Must be valid
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=... # Must match your index
```

**Check Pinecone Index:**
- Dimensions must be 1536
- Index must exist and be active
- API key must have write permissions

### Issue 3: Irrelevant Answers

**Possible Causes:**
- Not enough context in chunks
- Embeddings not properly created
- Query doesn't match content

**Solution:**
- Increase chunk size in text-chunker.ts
- Reprocess meetings
- Try more specific questions

### Issue 4: API Errors

**Check Browser Console (F12):**
```javascript
// Look for errors like:
"Failed to fetch embeddings"
"Pinecone connection error"
"OpenAI API error"
```

**Check Server Logs:**
```bash
# In your terminal running npm run dev
# Look for error messages
```
